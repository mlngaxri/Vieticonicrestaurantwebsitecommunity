# Image Assets Directory

This directory is where your static image assets should reside for the "Viet Iconic" website.

## Missing Files
The application is currently configured to look for the following files in this directory:

### General
- `viet-iconic-logo-full.png`
- `viet-iconic-logo-icon.png`
- `builder-logo.png`

### Hero Section
- `hero-sky-background.png`
- `hero-mountain-silhouette.png`

### Menu
- `menu-preview.png`
- `menu-drinks.png`

### Reviews
- `review-photo-1.png`
- `review-photo-2.png`

## How to Fix
1. Upload the actual PNG files corresponding to the names above into this `/public/assets/` folder.
2. Once uploaded, the images will automatically load in the application.
